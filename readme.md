# Homemade Food
Home made food is a platform based on sharing economy or Collaborative Consumption where people offer their skills and expertise to their neibourhood.

## Motivation
Main goal of this project is to empower homemakers to leverage their expertise and earn from home . With this web platform, the Home Chefs can sell their Home cooked food. The real taste of Indian food can only be enjoyed when it is home cooked with freshly grinded masalas. The freshly prepared masalas from home will have its rich natural aroma and taste that you cannot find in any commercial restaurants.
